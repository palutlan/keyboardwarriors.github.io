title: CIS-641 Term Project - iOS Notes App
---

The mobile app we are building is a Note-taking app for iOS. We are implementing this app using Swift. This app will have the ability to scan documents, images and save them to a note. We are going to use a local database to save the notes on the app. [Github Repo](https://github.com/palutlan/GVSU-CIS641-KEYBOARDWARRIORS)
